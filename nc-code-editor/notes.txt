in the other terminal cd into pythonAPI then run “python3 -m venv venv” then run “. venv/bin/activate” and then you’ll be in the venv and from there, you need to run “pip install -r requirements.txt” and then run “python3 app.py”

Using the directory explorer, navigate to the lib directory in the venv directory. From there, open the python3.12 directory and find the pyvis directory. Open the pyvis directory and then find the network.py file. On line 537 or in the function definition of the show function, change the default parameter of notebook=True to notebook=False.
